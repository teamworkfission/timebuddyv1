### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
```
JobManagement.tsx
├── CreateJobPost.tsx
├── PostTracking.tsx
│   ├── BusinessTileView.tsx
│   └── ApplicationsList.tsx
├── Shortlisted.tsx
│   ├── ShortlistedBusinessTileView.tsx
│   └── ApplicationsList.tsx (filtered)
└── Hired.tsx
    ├── HiredBusinessTileView.tsx
    └── ApplicationsList.tsx (hired only)
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Tab filtering logic
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'create' | 'tracking' | 'shortlisted' | 'hired'>('create');

// Job filtering by application status
const loadJobs = async () => {
  if (tab === 'shortlisted') {
    return getJobsWithApplicationStatus(['shortlisted', 'interviewed']);
  } else if (tab === 'hired') {
    return getJobsWithApplicationStatus(['hired']);
  } else {
    return getJobPosts(); // All jobs for Post Tracking
  }
};
```

#### API Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced job fetching with application status filtering
export async function getJobsWithApplicationStatus(
  applicationStatuses: string[], 
  businessId?: string
): Promise<JobPost[]> {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  applicationStatuses.forEach(status => params.append('application_status', status));
  if (businessId) params.append('business_id', businessId);
  
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/jobs/with-applications?${params.toString()}`);
  return response.json();
}
```

## 📊 Business Logic

### Smart Tab Filtering

#### Post Tracking Logic
```typescript
// Shows ALL jobs, filters applications to applied/reviewed
<ApplicationsList 
  jobPostId={job.id} 
  jobTitle={job.job_title}
  statusFilter={['applied', 'reviewed']}
  showActionButtons={true}
/>
```

#### Shortlisted Logic
```typescript
// Shows ONLY jobs with shortlisted/interviewed applications
const jobsWithShortlisted = await getJobsWithApplicationStatus(['shortlisted', 'interviewed']);

<ApplicationsList 
  jobPostId={job.id} 
  jobTitle={job.job_title}
  statusFilter={['shortlisted', 'interviewed']}
  showActionButtons={true}
/>
```

#### Hired Logic
```typescript
// Shows ONLY jobs with hired applications
const jobsWithHired = await getJobsWithApplicationStatus(['hired']);

<ApplicationsList 
  jobPostId={job.id} 
  jobTitle={job.job_title}
  statusFilter={['hired']}
  showActionButtons={false}
/>
```

### Application Status Transitions

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Applied] --> B[Reviewed]
    A --> C[Shortlisted]
    B --> C[Shortlisted]
    C --> D[Interviewed]
    C --> E[Hired]
    D --> E[Hired]
    A --> F[Rejected]
    B --> F[Rejected]
    C --> F[Rejected]
    D --> F[Rejected]
```

### Action Button Logic
```typescript
// Shortlist Button - Only show if not already shortlisted/interviewed/hired
{!['shortlisted', 'interviewed', 'hired'].includes(application.status) && (
  <button onClick={() => handleStatusUpdate(application.id, 'shortlisted')}>
    Shortlist ✅
  </button>
)}

// Hire Button - Show for all statuses except hired
{application.status !== 'hired' && (
  <button onClick={() => handleStatusUpdate(application.id, 'hired')}>
    Hire 🟩
  </button>
)}
```
